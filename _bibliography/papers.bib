  abstract={A growing body of evidence suggests interplay between the gut microbiota and the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, the role of the gut microbiome in early detection of NAFLD is unclear. Prospective studies are necessary for identifying reliable, microbiome markers for early NAFLD. We evaluated 2487 individuals in a community-based cohort who were followed up 4.6 years after initial clinical examination and biospecimen sampling. Metagenomic and metabolomic characterizations using stool and serum samples taken at baseline were performed for 90 participants who progressed to NAFLD and 90 controls who remained NAFLD free at the follow-up visit. Cases and controls were matched for gender, age, body mass index (BMI) at baseline and follow-up, and 4-year BMI change. Machine learning models integrating baseline microbial signatures (14 features) correctly classified participants (auROCs of 0.72 to 0.80) based on their NAFLD status and liver fat accumulation at the 4-year follow up, outperforming other prognostic clinical models (auROCs of 0.58 to 0.60). We confirmed the biological relevance of the microbiome features by testing their diagnostic ability in four external NAFLD case-control cohorts examined by biopsy or magnetic resonance spectroscopy, from Asia, Europe, and the United States. Our findings raise the possibility of using gut microbiota for early clinical warning of NAFLD development.},

  abstract={Currently, there is evidence that alteration in the gut ecosystem contributes to the development of liver diseases, however, the complex mechanisms involved are still unclear. We induced cholestasis in mice by bile duct ligation (BDL), mirroring the phenotype of a bile duct obstruction, to understand how gut microbiota alterations caused by an impaired flow of bile acid to the gut contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of liver disease. We performed longitudinal stool, heart, and liver sampling using mice receiving BDL and controls receiving sham operation (ShamOP). Shotgun metagenomics profiling using fecal samples taken before and on day 1, day 3, and day 7 after surgery was performed, and the cytokines and clinical chemistry profiles from heart blood, as well as the liver bile acids profile, were measured. The BDL surgery reshaped the microbiome of mice, resulting in highly distinct characteristics compared to the ShamOP. Our analysis of the microbiome pathways and ECs revealed that BDL reduces the production of hepatoprotective compounds in the gut, such as biotin, spermidine, arginine, and ornithine, which were negatively associated with inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-23, MCP-1). The reduction of the functional potential of the gut microbiota in producing those hepatoprotective compounds is associated with the decrease of beneficial bacteria species from Anaerotruncus, Blautia, Eubacterium, and Lachnoclostridium genera, as well as the increase of disease-associated bacteria e.g., Escherichia coli and Entercoccus faecalis. Our findings advances our knowledge of the gut microbiome-bile acids-liver triangle, which may serve as a potential therapeutic strategy for liver diseases.},

  abstract={Introduction: Gut microbial dysbiosis has been observed in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The beneficial impact of exercise, the recommended lifestyle change for NAFLD patients, might be mediated by the gut microbiome (GM). However, the exact taxonomic and functional signatures associated with the host’s clinical and biochemical improvement during exercise in NAFLD patients have not been elucidated yet. Objectives: To investigate the impact of exercise on GM and reveal GM structures associated with NAFLD improvement during exercise. Methods: Stool samples from a 12-weeks randomized controlled exercise study on NAFLD subjects (N = 39) were retrieved and shotgun metagenomics was performed at baseline and endpoint. Differential correlation network and enrichment analysis were applied to characterize the GM taxonomic and functional changes during the exercise intervention and to associate GM changes with biomarkers of liver status and metabolic dysregulation. Results: Network analysis demonstrated that exercise induced significant changes in the bacterial interactome, which were associated with waist circumference, resting metabolic rate, plasma fasting concentrations of triglyceride, glucose, insulin, and glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Grouping the patients in the exercise group (N = 20) as responders (N = 13) and non-responders (N = 7) using their intrahepatic lipid content (IHL) change allowed us to identify bacteria consortia contributing to the levels of alanine fermentation, methanol-, creatinine- and protocatechuate degradation and as a result to the plasma concentrations of liver injury markers alanine transaminase (ALT), gamma-glutamyl transaminase (GGT), and aspartate transaminase (AST). Conclusion: We showed that even though exercise has not a significant impact on the alpha and beta diversity of NAFLD patients, it leads to a significant re-structuring of the gut bacteria interactome and that specific structural changes can be linked with improvements in IHL.}

  abstract={Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a hepatic manifestation of metabolic dysfunctions for which effective interventions are lacking. To investigate the effects of resistant starch (RS) as a microbiota-directed dietary supplement for NAFLD treatment, we conducted a randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial of 4 months in individuals with NAFLD (ChiCTR-IOR-15007519), coupled with metagenomics and metabolomics analysis. Relative to the control (n=97), the RS intervention (n=99) resulted in a 9.08% absolute reduction of intrahepatic triglyceride content (IHTC), which was 5.89% after adjusting for weight loss. Serum branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) and gut microbial species, in particular Bacteroides stercoris, significantly correlated with IHTC and liver enzymes, and were reduced by RS. Multi-omics integrative analyses revealed the interplay among gut microbiota changes, BCAA availability, and hepatic steatosis, with causality supported by fecal microbiota transplantation and monocolonization. Thus, dietary supplementation with RS might be a strategy for managing NAFLD by altering gut microbiota composition and functionality.}
